# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### 3 Project features:

- This website is a good website for buying cars and bikes.
- Here, detailed information about any car and bike can be found. To do that, one needs to sign up first.
- Again, if someone wants, they can add features to the bike or car according to their preferences.
- If someone wishes, they can update information about any car or bike, but they must log in first to do so.
- If someone wants to buy something, after adding it to the cart, it will be displayed on the 'My Cart' page, and they can delete the product if they wish.
